    "45": "Chapter 1\nA LONG-EXPECTED PARTY\nWhen Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly\nbe celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special mag-\nnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\nBilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder\nof the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance\nand unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his\ntravels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed,\nwhatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of\ntunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame,\nthere was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it\nseemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the\nsame as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but\nunchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that\nshook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it\nseemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual\nyouth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.\n\u2018It will have to be paid for,\u2019 they said. \u2018It isn\u2019t natural, and trouble\nwill come of it!\u2019\nBut so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous\nwith his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities\nand his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives\n(except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many de-\nvoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.\nBut he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began\nto grow up.\nThe eldest of these, and Bilbo\u2019s favourite, was young Frodo\nBaggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir,\nand brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-\nBagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have\nthe same birthday, September 22nd. \u2018You had better come and live\nhere, Frodo my lad,\u2019 said Bilbo one day; \u2018and then we can celebrate\nour birthday-parties comfortably together.\u2019 At that time Frodo was\nstill in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties\nbetween childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.",
    "46": "understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for\nthat autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious\nnumber, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself\nhad only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33,an\nimportant number: the date of his \u2018coming of age\u2019.\nTongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of\nthe coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and charac-\nter of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conver-\nsation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in\nwelcome demand.\nNo one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee,\ncommonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a\nsmall inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority,\nfor he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had\nhelped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was\nhimself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried\non by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on\nvery friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill\nitself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.\n\u2018A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I\u2019ve always\nsaid,\u2019 the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very\npolite to him, calling him \u2018Master Hamfast\u2019, and consulting him\nconstantly upon the growing of vegetables \u2013 in the matter of \u2018roots\u2019,\nespecially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority\nby all in the neighbourhood (including himself ).\n\u2018But what about this Frodo that lives with him?\u2019 asked Old Noakes\nof Bywater. \u2018Baggins is his name, but he\u2019s more than half a Brandy-\nbuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go\nlooking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.\u2019\n\u2018And no wonder they\u2019re queer,\u2019 put in Daddy Twofoot (the\nGaffer\u2019s next-door neighbour), \u2018if they live on the wrong side of the\nBrandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That\u2019s a dark bad\nplace, if half the tales be true.\u2019\n\u2018You\u2019re right, Dad!\u2019 said the Gaffer. \u2018Not that the Brandybucks\nof Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they\u2019re a queer breed, seem-\ningly. They fool about with boats on that big river \u2013 and that isn\u2019t\nnatural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as\nit may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to\nmeet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all\nhis father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo\nBaggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.\u2019\n\u2018Drownded?\u2019 said several voices. They had heard this and other",
    "47": "\u2018Well, so they say,\u2019 said the Gaffer. \u2018You see: Mr. Drogo, he\nmarried poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo\u2019s\nfirst cousin on the mother\u2019s side (her mother being the youngest of\nthe Old Took\u2019s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin.\nSo Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either\nway, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying\nat Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he\noften did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old\nGorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating\non the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and\npoor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,\u2019\nsaid Old Noakes; \u2018and it was Drogo\u2019s weight as sunk the boat.\u2019\n\u2018And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,\u2019\nsaid Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\n\u2018You shouldn\u2019t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,\u2019 said the Gaffer,\nwho did not much like the miller. \u2018There isn\u2019t no call to go talking\nof pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that\nsit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway:\nthere was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might\nsay, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in\nBrandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc\nnever had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr.\nBilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to\nlive among decent folk.\n\u2018But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses.\nThey thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he\nwent off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and\norders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking\na day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has\nall the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won\u2019t never\nsee the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.\u2019\n\u2018There\u2019s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,\u2019\nsaid a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the\nWestfarthing. \u2018All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with\nchests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I\u2019ve heard.\u2019\n\u2018Then you\u2019ve heard more than I can speak to,\u2019 answered the\nGaffer. \u2018I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money,\nand there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw\nMr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I\nwas a lad. I\u2019d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my\ndad\u2019s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep",
    "48": "a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don\u2019t\ndoubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign\nparts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn\u2019t\nenough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that.\nHe\u2019s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days, he\nis, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo\u2019s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him\nhis letters \u2013 meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will\ncome of it.\n\u2018Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better\nfor me and you. Don\u2019t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters,\nor you\u2019ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might say\nit to others,\u2019 he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.\nBut the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of\nBilbo\u2019s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger\ngeneration of hobbits.\n\u2018Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at\nfirst,\u2019 argued the miller, voicing common opinion. \u2018He\u2019s often away\nfrom home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves\ncoming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all.\nYou can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End\u2019s a queer place, and\nits folk are queerer.\u2019\n\u2018And you can say what you like, about what you know no more\nof than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,\u2019 retorted the Gaffer, dislik-\ning the miller even more than usual. \u2018If that\u2019s being queer, then we\ncould do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There\u2019s some not\nfar away that wouldn\u2019t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived\nin a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End.\nOur Sam says that everyone\u2019s going to be invited to the party, and\nthere\u2019s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all \u2013 this very\nmonth as is.\u2019\nThat very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A\nday or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable\nSam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks \u2013 fire-\nworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh\non a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.\nDays passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon\nladen with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening\nand toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out\nof lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing\nstrange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of\nthem remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in Sep-",
    "49": "He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf.\nHe had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond\nthe brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through\nHobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they\nrightly guessed. At Bilbo\u2019s front door the old man began to unload:\nthere were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each\nlabelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .\nThat was Gandalf \u2019s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf\nthe Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with\nfires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and\ndangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he\nwas just one of the \u2018attractions\u2019 at the Party. Hence the excitement\nof the hobbit-children. \u2018G for Grand!\u2019 they shouted, and the old man\nsmiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbi-\nton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any\nbut the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays \u2013\nthey now belonged to a legendary past.\nWhen the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had\nfinished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single\nsquib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the\nonlookers.\n\u2018Run away now!\u2019 said Gandalf. \u2018You will get plenty when the time\ncomes.\u2019 Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was\nshut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and\nthen made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.\nInside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window\nof a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon\nwas bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-\ndragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls\nand peeping in at the round windows.\n\u2018How bright your garden looks!\u2019 said Gandalf.\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Bilbo. \u2018I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear\nold Shire; but I think I need a holiday.\u2019\n\u2018You mean to go on with your plan then?\u2019\n\u2018I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven\u2019t changed it.\u2019\n\u2018Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan \u2013\nyour whole plan, mind \u2013 and I hope it will turn out for the best, for\nyou, and for all of us.\u2019\n\u2018I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have\nmy little joke.\u2019\n\u2018Who will laugh, I wonder?\u2019 said Gandalf, shaking his head.",
    "50": "The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts.\nThere might have been some grumbling about \u2018dealing locally\u2019, but\nthat very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind\nof provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbi-\nton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became\nenthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and\nthey watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.\nBefore long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton\npost-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed\nunder, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a\nconstant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of\npolite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.\nA notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittance\nexcept on party business. Even those who had, or pretended to\nhave Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy:\nwriting invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and\nmaking some private preparations of his own. From the time of\nGandalf \u2019s arrival he remained hidden from view.\nOne morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of\nBilbo\u2019s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pav-\nilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road,\nand wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three\nhobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely\ninterested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even\npretending to work in his garden.\nThe tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so\nbig that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood\nproudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were\nhung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits\u2019 mind):\nan enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the\nfield. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles\naround, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that\nwere quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.\nThen the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve\nof the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the\n22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags\nwere unfurled and the fun began.\nBilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of enter-\ntainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was\ninvited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned\nup all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts\noftheShirewerealsoasked;andtherewereevenafewfromoutside",
    "51": "were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by\nthe gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays.\nNot very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this\noccasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and\nBywater every day in the year was somebody\u2019s birthday, so that every\nhobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least\nonce a week. But they never got tired of them.\nOn this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-\nchildren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about\neating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before,\nall beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed\nbeen ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the\nMountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.\nWhen every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the\ngate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food\nand drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner\n(or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that\nat those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together.\nAt other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking\n\u2013continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks\nstarted.\nThe fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by\nhim, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set\npieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was also\na generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers,\ntorches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-\nclaps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.\nThere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with\nsweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their\nleaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their\nshining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished\nhobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their\nupturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering\ninto the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned\ninto eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was\na red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest\nof silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an\nembattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss\nlike a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in\nhonour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf\nintended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped\nitself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the",
    "52": "his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times\nover the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on\ntheir faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somer-\nsault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.\n\u2018That is the signal for supper!\u2019 said Bilbo. The pain and alarm\nvanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There\nwas a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those\ninvited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great\npavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen\n(a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word\nwas not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were\nselected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related,\nwith the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ).\nMany young hobbits were included, and present by parental per-\nmission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter\nof sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them\na free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.\nThere were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and\nBrandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins\u2019\ngrandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grand-\nfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brock-\nhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these\nwere only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly\never been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the\nShire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife\nLobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but\nso magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that\nthey had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo,\nhad been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high\nreputation.\nAll the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant\nfeast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their\nhost (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he\ncalled poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to\nthe absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were\nnot disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing\nentertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase\nof provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the\nensuing weeks; but as Bilbo\u2019s catering had depleted the stocks of\nmost of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did\nnot matter much.\nAfter the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the com-",
    "53": "favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their\nfears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, and\nto cheer at every full stop.\nMy dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. \u2018Hear! Hear! Hear!\u2019\nthey shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant\nto follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood\non a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell\non his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered\nsilk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in\nthe air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.\nMy dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks\nand Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Horn-\nblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.\n\u2018Proudfeet!\u2019 shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion.\nHis name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were\nlarge, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.\nProudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I\nwelcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh\nbirthday: I am eleventy-one today! \u2018Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy\nReturns!\u2019 they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables.\nBilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked:\nshort and obvious.\nI hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening\ncheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes\nand flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been\nsaid, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had\nbeen pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did\nnot convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they\nwere marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of\nperfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of\nthe young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have\nfinished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got\nup an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master\nEverard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with\nbells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance,\nbut rather vigorous.\nBut Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby,\nhe blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall not keep you\nlong, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I have called you all\ntogether for a Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made\nan impression. There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks\npricked up their ears.",
    "54": "among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of\napproval.\nI don\u2019t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less\nthan half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and\nrather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them\nwere trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.\nSecondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR\nbirthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew,\nFrodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory\nclapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of \u2018Frodo! Frodo! Jolly\nold Frodo,\u2019 from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and\nwondered what was meant by \u2018coming into his inheritance\u2019.\nTogether we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were\nchosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression.\nNo cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especially\nthe Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had only\nbeen asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package.\n\u2018One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.\u2019\nIt is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary\nof my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact\nthat it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only\nfifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was\nvery splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember,\nand could only say \u2018thag you very buch\u2019. I now repeat it more correctly:\nThank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence.\nThey all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and\nthey were getting bored. Why couldn\u2019t he stop talking and let them\ndrink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a\nmoment.\nThirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT.\nHe spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up\nwho still could. I regret to announce that \u2013 though, as I said, eleventy-one\nyears is far too short a time to spend among you \u2013 this is the END. I am\ngoing. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!\nHe stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of\nlight, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo\nwas nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted\nhobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet\nfrom the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until\nsuddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took,\nBrandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brock-",
    "55": "food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance.\n\u2018He\u2019s mad. I always said so,\u2019 was probably the most popular comment.\nEven the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo\u2019s behaviour\nwas absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that\nhis disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.\nBut old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an\nenormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-\nlaw, Esmeralda: \u2018There\u2019s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe\nthat mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He\nhasn\u2019t taken the vittles with him.\u2019 He called loudly to Frodo to send\nthe wine round again.\nFrodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some\ntime he had sat silent beside Bilbo\u2019s empty chair, and ignored all\nremarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even\nthough he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from\nlaughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same\ntime he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the\nold hobbit dearly.
